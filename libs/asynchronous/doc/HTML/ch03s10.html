                    application does not offer enough flexibility in load planning. It is pretty
                    hard to avoid either oversubscription (more busy threads than available hardware
                    threads) or undersubscription. One would need one big threadpool with exactly
                    the number of threads available in the hardware. Unfortunately, if we have a
                    hardware with, say 12 hardware threads, parallelizing some work using all 12
                    might be slowlier than using only 8. One would need different threadpools of
                    different number of threads for the application. This, however, has the serious
                    drawback that there is a risk that some threadpools will be in overload, while
                    others are out of work unless we have work stealing between different
                    threadpools.</p><p>The second issue is task priority. One can define priorities with several
                    queues or a queue container, but this ensures that only highest priority tasks
                    get executed if the system is coming close to overload. Ideally, it would be
                    great if we could decide how much compute power we give to each task
                    type.</p><p>This is what <code class="code">composite_threadpool_scheduler</code> solves. This pool
                    supports, like any other pool, the
                    <code class="code">any_shared_scheduler_proxy</code>concept so you can use it in place of the
                    ones we used so far. The pool is composed of other pools
                        (<code class="code">any_shared_scheduler_proxy</code> pools). It implements work stealing
                    between pools if a) the pools support it and b) the queue of a pool also does.
                    For example, if we define as worker of a servant inside a single-threaded
                    scheduler:</p><p>
                    </p><pre class="programlisting">// create a composite threadpool made of:
// a multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler, 1 thread, with a lockfree_queue of capacity 100. 
// This scheduler does not steal from other schedulers, but will lend its queue for stealing
boost::asynchronous::any_shared_scheduler_proxy&lt;&gt; tp = boost::asynchronous::create_shared_scheduler_proxy( 
               new boost::asynchronous::multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler&lt;boost::asynchronous::lockfree_queue&lt;&gt; &gt; (1,100));

// a stealing_multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler, 3 threads, each with a threadsafe_list
// this scheduler will steal from other schedulers if it can. In this case it will manage only with tp, not tp3
boost::asynchronous::any_shared_scheduler_proxy&lt;&gt; tp2 = boost::asynchronous::create_shared_scheduler_proxy( 
                    new boost::asynchronous::stealing_multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler&lt;boost::asynchronous::threadsafe_list&lt;&gt; &gt; (3));

// a multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler, 4 threads, each with a lockfree_spsc_queue of capacity 100
// this works because there will be no stealing as the queue can't, and only this single-thread scheduler will be the producer
boost::asynchronous::any_shared_scheduler_proxy&lt;&gt; tp3 = boost::asynchronous::create_shared_scheduler_proxy( 
               new boost::asynchronous::multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler&lt;boost::asynchronous::lockfree_spsc_queue&lt;&gt; &gt; (4,100));

// create a composite pool made of the 3 previous ones
boost::asynchronous::any_shared_scheduler_proxy&lt;&gt; tp_worker =
             boost::make_shared&lt;boost::asynchronous::composite_threadpool_scheduler&lt;&gt; &gt; (tp,tp2,tp3);
                    </pre><p>
                </p><p>We can use this pool:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>As a big worker pool. In this case, the priority argument we use
                                for posting refers to the (1-based) index of the subpool
                                (post_callback(func1,func2,"task name",<span class="bold"><strong>1</strong></span>,0);). "1" means post to the first pool. But the
                                second pool could steal the work.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As a pool container, but different parts of the code will get to
                                see only the subpools. For example, the pools tp, tp2 and tp3 can
                                still be used independently as a worker pool. Calling
                                composite_threadpool_scheduler&lt;&gt;::get_scheduler(std::size_t
                                index_of_pool) will also give us the corresponding pool (1-based, as
                                always).</p></li></ul></div><p>A good example of why to use this pool is if you have a threadpool for an
                    asio-based communication. Using such a pool inside the composite pool will allow
                    the threads of this pool to help (steal) other pools if they have nothing to do. </p><p>Stealing is done with priority. A stealing poll first tries to steal from the
                    first pool, then from the second, etc.</p><p>The <a class="link" href="examples/example_composite_threadpool.cpp" target="_top">following
                        example</a> shows a complete servant implementation, and the <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch03s11.html#asio_scheduler">ASIO section</a></strong></span> will show how an ASIO
                    pool can steal.</p><p>The threadpool schedulers we saw so far are not stealing from other pools. The
                    single-queue schedulers are not stealing, and the multiqueue schedulers steal
                    from the queues of other threads of the same pool. The stealing schedulers
                    usually indicate this by appending a <code class="code">stealing_</code> to their name:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><code class="code">stealing_threadpool_scheduler</code> is a
                                    <code class="code">threadpool_scheduler</code> which steals from other
                                pools.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="code">stealing_multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler</code> is a
                                    <code class="code">multiqueue_threadpool scheduler</code> which steals from
                                other pools.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="code">asio_scheduler steals</code>.</p></li></ul></div><p>The only difference with their not stealing equivalent is that they need a
                    composite_scheduler to tell them from which queues they can steal.</p><p>Not all schedulers offer a queue to steal from. A
                        <code class="code">single_thread_scheduler</code> does not as it would likely bring race
                    conditions in active objects. If you do want to allow stealing, use a threadpool
                    with 1 thread. An <code class="code">asio_scheduler</code> also offers no queue to steal from
                    although it can steal from other queues because Boost.Asio does not offer this
                    in its interface. Future extensions will overcome this.</p><p>TODO priority posting</p><p>Another interesting usage will be when planning for extra machines to help a
                    threadpool by processing some of the work: jobs can be stolen from a threadpool
                    by a <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch03s14.html#distributing">tcp_server_scheduler</a></strong></span> from which other machines can
                    get them. Just pack both pools in a <code class="code">composite_threadpool_scheduler</code>
                    and you're ready to go.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s09.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s11.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Threadpool Schedulers with several queues&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;asio_scheduler</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
