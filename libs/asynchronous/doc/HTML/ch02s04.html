Consider the
                    following class:</p><p>
                    </p><pre class="programlisting">struct Unsafe
{
  void foo()
  {
    m_mutex.lock();
    // call private member
    m_mutex.unlock();
  }
private:
  void foobar()
  {
    //we are already locked when called, do something while locked
  }
  boost::mutex m_mutex;
};            </pre><p>
                </p><p>This is called a thread-safe interface pattern. Public members lock, private
                    do not. Simple enough. Unfortunately, it doesn't fly.</p><p>First one has the risk of deadlock if a private member calls a public one
                    while being called from another public member. If we forget to check one path of
                    execution within a class implementation, we get a deadlock. We'll have to test
                    every single path of execution to prove our code is correct. And this at every
                    commit.</p><p>Usually, for any complex class, where there's a mutex, there is a race or a
                    deadlock...</p><p>But even worse, the principle itself is not correct in C++. It supposes that a
                    class can protect itself. Well, no, it can't. Why? One cannot protect the
                    destructor. If the object (and the mutex) gets destroyed when a thread waits for
                    it in foo(), we get a crash or an exception. We can mitigate this with the use
                    of a shared_ptr, then we have no destructor call while someone waits for the
                    mutex. Unfortunately, we still have a risk of a signal, callback, etc. all those
                    things mixing badly with threads. And if we use too many shared_ptr's, we start
                    having lifetime issues or leaks. </p><p>There are more lifetime issues, even without mutexes or threads. If you have
                    ever used Boost.Asio, a common mistake and an easy one is when a callback is
                    called in the proactor thread after an asynchronous operation, but the object
                    called is long gone and the callback invalid. Asynchronous provides <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch03s03.html#trackable_servant">trackable_servant</a></strong></span> which makes sure
                    that a callback is not called if the object which called the asynchronous
                    operation is gone. It also prevents a task posted in a threadpool to be called
                    if this condition occurs, which improves performance. Asynchronous also provides
                    a safe callback for use as Boost.Asio or similar asynchronous libraries.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Shutting down&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Servant Proxies</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
