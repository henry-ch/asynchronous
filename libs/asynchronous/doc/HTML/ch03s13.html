                    other tasks, which start other tasks, until all threads in the threadpool are
                    busy waiting. At this point, one could add more threads, but threads are
                    expensive. Similarly, you might post a task which posts more tasks and wait for
                    them to complete to do a merge of the result. Of course you can achieve this
                    with a controller object or state machine in a single-threaded scheduler waiting
                    for callbacks, but for very small tasks, using callbacks might just be too
                    expensive. In such cases, Asynchronous provides continuations: a task executes,
                    does something then creates a continuation which will wake up when ready.</p><p>A common example of recursive tasks is a parallel fibonacci. Usually, this
                    means a task calculating fib(n) will start a fib(n-1) and fib(n-2) and blocks
                    until both are done. These tasks will start more tasks, etc. until a cutoff
                    number, at which point recursion stops and fibonacci is calculated serially.
                    This approach has some problems: to avoid thread explosion, we would need
                    fibers, which are not available in Boost at the time of this writing, and even
                    in fibers, tasks would block, which means interrupting them is not possible,
                    which we would want to avoid. In any case, blocking simply isn't part of the
                    asynchronous philosophy of the library. Let's have a look how continuation tasks
                    let us implement a parallel fibonacci.</p><p>First of all, we need a serial fibonacci to use for the cutoff. This is a
                    classical one:</p><pre class="programlisting"> long serial_fib( long n ) {
    if( n&lt;2 )
        return n;
    else
        return serial_fib(n-1)+serial_fib(n-2);
}                                   
                </pre><p> We now need a recursive fibonacci task: </p><pre class="programlisting">// our recursive fibonacci tasks. Needs to inherit continuation_task&lt;value type returned by this task&gt;
struct fib_task : public boost::asynchronous::continuation_task&lt;long&gt;
{
    fib_task(long n,long cutoff):n_(n),cutoff_(cutoff){}
    // called inside of threadpool
    void operator()()const
    {
        // the result of this task, will be either set directly if &lt; cutoff, otherwise when taks is ready
        boost::asynchronous::continuation_result&lt;long&gt; task_res = this_task_result();
        if (n_&lt;cutoff_)
        {
            // n &lt; cutoff =&gt; execute immediately
            task_res.set_value(serial_fib(n_));
        }
        else
        {
            // n&gt;= cutoff, create 2 new tasks and when both are done, set our result (res(task1) + res(task2))
            boost::asynchronous::create_continuation&lt;long&gt;(
                        // called when subtasks are done, set our result
                        [task_res](std::tuple&lt;boost::future&lt;long&gt;,boost::future&lt;long&gt; &gt;&amp;&amp; res)
                        {
                            long r = std::get&lt;0&gt;(res).get() + std::get&lt;1&gt;(res).get();
                            task_res.set_value(r);
                        },
                        // recursive tasks
                        fib_task(n_-1,cutoff_),
                        fib_task(n_-2,cutoff_));
        }
    }
    long n_;
    long cutoff_;
};                               
                </pre><p> This deserves a bit of explanation. Our task need to inherit
                        <code class="code">boost::asynchronous::continuation_task&lt;R&gt;</code> where R is the
                    type later returned. This class provides us with <code class="code">this_task_result()</code>
                    where we set the task result. This is done either immediately if n &lt; cutoff
                    (first if clause), or (else clause) using a continuation.</p><p>If n&gt;= cutoff, we create a continuation task. This is a sleeping task, which
                    will get activated when all required tasks complete. In this case, we have two
                    fibonacci sub tasks. The template argument is the return type of the
                    continuation. We create two sub-tasks, for n-1 and n-2 and when they complete,
                    the completion functor passed as first argument is called.</p><p>Note that <code class="code">boost::asynchronous::create_continuation</code> is a variadic
                    function, there can be any number of sub-tasks. The completion functor takes as
                    single argument a tuple of futures, one for each subtask. The template argument
                    of the future is the template argument of
                        <code class="code">boost::asynchronous::continuation_task</code> of each subtask. In this
                    case, all are long, but it's not a requirement.</p><p>When this completion functor is called, we set our result to be result of
                    first task + result of second task and return.</p><p>The main particularity of this solution is that a task does not block until
                    sub-tasks complete but instead provides an asynchronous functor.</p><p>All what we still need to do is create the first task. In the tradition of
                    Asynchronous, we do it inside an asynchronous servant which posts the first task
                    and waits for a callback:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct Servant : boost::asynchronous::trackable_servant&lt;&gt;
{
...
   void calc_fibonacci(long n,long cutoff)
   {
      post_callback(
            [n,cutoff]()
            {
                // a top-level continuation is the first one in a recursive serie.
                // Its result will be passed to callback
                return boost::asynchronous::top_level_continuation&lt;long&gt;(fib_task(n,cutoff));
            }// work
            ,
            // callback with fibonacci result.
            [](boost::future&lt;long&gt; res){...}// callback functor.
        );                                 
   }  
   };          </pre><p> We call <code class="code">post_callback</code>, which, as usual, ensure that the callback
                    is posted to the right thread and the servant lifetime is tracked. The posted
                    task calls
                        <code class="code">boost::asynchronous::top_level_continuation&lt;task-return-type&gt;</code>
                    to create the first, top-level continuation, passing it a first fib_task. This
                    is non-blocking, a special version of <code class="code">post_callback</code> recognizes a
                    continuation and will call its callback (with a
                        <code class="code">future&lt;task-return-type&gt;</code>) only when the calculation is
                    finished.</p><p>As usual, calling get on the future is non-blocking, one gets eaither the
                    result or an exception if thrown by a task.</p><p>Please have a look at the <a class="link" href="examples/example_fibonacci.cpp" target="_top">complete example</a>.</p><p>And what about logging? We don't want to give up this feature of course and
                    would like to know how long all these fib_task took to complete. This is done
                    through minor changes. As always we need a job, the same as usual:</p><pre class="programlisting">typedef boost::asynchronous::any_loggable&lt;boost::chrono::high_resolution_clock&gt; servant_job;                                 
                </pre><p> We give the logged name of the task in the constructor of fib_task, for
                    example fib_task_xxx:</p><pre class="programlisting">fib_task(long n,long cutoff)
        : boost::asynchronous::continuation_task&lt;long&gt;("fib_task_" + boost::lexical_cast&lt;std::string&gt;(n))

                </pre><p>And call <code class="code">boost::asynchronous::create_continuation_log</code> instead of
                        <code class="code">boost::asynchronous::create_continuation</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">boost::asynchronous::<span class="bold"><strong>create_continuation_log</strong></span>&lt;long,servant_job&gt;(

                        {
                            long r = std::get&lt;0&gt;(res).get() + std::get&lt;1&gt;(res).get();

                        fib_task(n_-1,cutoff_),

                </pre><p> Inside the servant we might optionally want the version of post_callback with
