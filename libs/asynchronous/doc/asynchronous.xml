        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            <emphasis role="underline">Note</emphasis>: Asynchronous is not part of the Boost
            library. It is planed to be offered for Review at the beginning of 2016. </para>
        <para>Herb Sutter wrote <link
                xlink:href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm">in an
                article</link> "The Free Lunch Is Over", meaning that developpers will be forced to
            learn to develop multi-threaded applications. The reason is that we now get our extra
            power in the form of more cores. The problem is: multithreading is hard! It's full of
            ugly beasts waiting hidden for our mistakes: races, deadlocks, crashes, all kinds of
            subtle timing-dependent bugs. Worse yet, these bugs are hard to find because they are
            never reproducible when we are looking for them, which leaves us with backtrace
            analysis, and this is when we are lucky enough to have a backtrace in the first
            place.</para>
        <para>This is not even the only danger. CPUs are a magnitude faster than memory, I/O
            operations, network communications, which all stall our programms and degrade our
            performance, which means long sessions with coverage or analysis tools.</para>
        <para>Trying to solve these problems with tools of the past (mutexes, programmer-managed
            threads) is a dead-end. It's just too hard. This is where Boost Asynchronous is
            helping.</para>
        <para>There are already existing solutions for this. To name a few:</para>
        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>std/boost::async.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Intel TBB.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>N3428.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>TBB is a wonderful parallel library. But it's not asynchronous as one needs to wait
            for the end of a parallel call.</para>
        <para>std::async will return us a future. But what will we do with it? Wait for it? This
            would be synchronous. Collect them and then wait for all? This would also be
            synchronous. Collect them, do something else, then check if they are ready? This would
            be wasted opportunity for more calculations. To make it worse, I/O usage will seriously
            degrade performance.</para>
        <para>To solve these problems, NB3428 is an attempt at continuations. Let's have a quick
            look at code using futures and .then (taken from N3428):</para>
        <para>
            <programlisting>future&lt;int> f1 = async([]() { return 123; });
future&lt;string> f2 = f1.then([](future&lt;int> f) {return f.get().to_string();}); // here .get() won’t block
f2.get(); // just a "small get" at the end?</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>Saying that there is only a "small get" at the end is, for an application with
            real-time constraints, equivalent to saying at a lockfree conference something like
            "what is all the fuss about? Can't we just add a small lock at the end?". Just try
            it...</para>
        <para>Worse yet, it clutters the code, makes it hard to debug and understand. When did we
            give up writing design diagrams? How is this supposed to replace a dynamic behavior
            using a state machine?</para>
        <para>Asynchronous supports this programming model too, though it is advised to use it only
            for simple programs or quick prototyping, or as a step to the more powerful tools
            offered by the library. std::async can be replaced by
            boost::asynchronous::post_future:</para>
        <programlisting>auto pool = boost::asynchronous::make_shared_scheduler_proxy&lt;
                  boost::asynchronous::multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler&lt;
                        boost::asynchronous::lockfree_queue&lt;>>>(8); // create a pool with 8 threads
boost::future&lt;int> fu = boost::asynchronous::post_future(pool,
    []()
    {
        return 123;
    });
f1.get();</programlisting>
        <para>Instead of an ugly future.then, Asynchronous supports continuations as coded into the
            task itself. We will see later how to do it. For the moment, here is a quick example.
            Let's say we want to modify a vector in parallel, then reduce it, also in parallel,
            without having to write synchronization points:</para>
        <programlisting>boost::future&lt;int> fu = boost::asynchronous::post_future(pool, // pool as before
    [this]()
    {
        return boost::asynchronous::parallel_reduce(                   // reduce will be done in parallel after for
            boost::asynchronous::parallel_for(std::move(this->m_data), // our data, a std::vector&lt;int> will be moved, transformed, then reduced and eventually destroyed
                                              [](int&amp; i)
                                              {
                                                  i += 2;              // transform all elements in parallel
                                              }, 1024),                // cutoff (when to go sequential. Will be explained later)
            [](int const&amp; a, int const&amp; b)                             // reduce function
            {
                return a + b;
            }, 1024);                                                  // reduce cutoff
    });
int res = fu.get();</programlisting>
        <para>But this is just the beginning. It is not even really asynchronous. More important,
            Boost Asynchronous is a library which can play a great role in making a thread-correct
            architecture. To achieve this, it offers tools for asynchronous designs: ActiveObject,
            safe callbacks, threadpools, servants, proxies, queues, algorithms, etc. </para>
        <para>Consider the following example showing us why we need an architecture tool:</para>
        <para>
            <programlisting>struct Bad : public boost::signals::trackable
{
   int foo();
};
boost::shared_ptr&lt;Bad> b;
future&lt;int> f = async([b](){return b->foo()});          </programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>Now we have the ugly problem of not knowing in which thread Bad will be destroyed. And
            as it's pretty hard to have a thread-safe destructor, we find ourselves with a race
            condition in it. </para>
        <para>Asynchronous programming has the advantage of allowing to design of code, which is
            nonblocking and single-threaded while still utilizing parallel hardware at full
            capacity. And all this while forgetting what a mutex is. </para>
        <para>This brings us to a central point of Asynchronous: if we build a system with strict
            real-time constraints, there is no such thing as a small blocking get(). We need to be
            able to react to any event in the system in a timely manner. And we can't afford to have
            lots of functions potentially waiting too long everywhere in our code. Therefore,
            .then() is only good for an application of a few hundreds of lines. What about using a
            timed_wait instead? Nope. This just limits the amount of time we waste waiting. Either
            we wait too long before handling an error or result, or we wait not enough and we poll.
            In any case, while waiting, our thread cannot react to other events and wastes
            time.</para>
        <para>An image being more worth than thousand words, the following story will explain in a
            few minutes what Asynchronous is about. Consider some fast-food restaurant:</para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="pics/Proactor1.jpg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </inlinemediaobject>
        </para>
        <para>This restaurant has a single employee, Worker, who delivers burgers through a burger
            queue and drinks. A Customer comes. Then another, who waits until the first customer is
            served.</para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="pics/Proactor2.jpg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </inlinemediaobject></para>
        <para>To keep customers happy by reducing waiting time, the restaurant owner hires a second
            employee:</para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="pics/Proactor3.jpg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </inlinemediaobject></para>
        <para>Unfortunately, this brings chaos in the restaurant. Sometimes, employes fight to get a
            burger to their own customer first:</para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="pics/Proactor-RC.jpg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </inlinemediaobject></para>
        <para>And sometimes, they stay in each other's way:</para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="pics/Proactor-DL.jpg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </inlinemediaobject></para>
        <para>This clearly is a not an optimal solution. Not only the additional employee brings
            additional costs, but both employees now spend much more time waiting. It also is not a
            scalable solution if even more customers want to eat because it's lunch-time right now.
            Even worse, as they fight for resources and stay in each other's way, the restaurant now
            serves people less fast than before. Customers flee and the restaurant gets bankrupt. A
            sad story, isn't it? To avoid this, the owner decides to go asynchronous. He keeps a
            single worker, who runs in zero time from cash desk to cash desk:</para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="pics/Proactor-async.jpg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </inlinemediaobject></para>
        <para>The worker never waits because it would increase customer's waiting time. Instead, he
            runs from cash desks to the burger queue, beverage machine using a self-made strategy: <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>ask what the customer wants and keep an up-to-date information of the
                        customer's state.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>if we have another customer at a desk, ask what he wants. For both
                        customers, remember the state of the order (waiting for customer choice,
                        getting food, getting drink, delivering, getting payment, etc.)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>as soon as some new state is detected (customer choice, burger in the
                        queue, drink ready), handle it.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>priorities are defined: start the longest-lasting tasks first, serve
                        angry-looking customers first, etc.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>The following diagram shows us the busy and really really fast worker in
            action:</para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="pics/Proactor-async2.jpg"/>
                </imageobject>
            </inlinemediaobject></para>
        <para>Of course the owner needs a worker who runs fast, and has a pretty good memory so he
            can remember what customers are waiting for. </para>
        <para>This is what Asynchronous is for. A worker (thread) runs as long as there are waiting
            customers, following a precisely defined algorithm, and lots of state machines to manage
            the asynchronous behaviour. In case of customers, we could have a state machine: Waiting
            -> PickingMenu -> WaitingForFood -> Paying.</para>
        <para>We also need some queues (Burger queue, Beverage glass positioning) and some
            Asynchronous Operation Processor (for example a threadpool made of workers in the
            kitchen), event of different types (Drinks delivery). Maybe we also want some work
            stealing (someone in the kitchen serving drinks as he has no more burger to prepare. He
            will be slower than the machine, but still bring some time gain).</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">To make this work, the worker must not block, never,
                ever</emphasis>. And whatever he's doing has to be as fast as possible, otherwise
            the whole process stalls.</para>

                <title>std::async</title>
                <subtitle>What is wrong with it</subtitle>
                <para>The following code is a classical use of std::async as it can be found in
                    articles, books, etc.</para>
                <programlisting>std::future&lt;int> f = std::async([](){return 42;}); // executes asynchronously
int res = f.get(); // wait for result, block until ready</programlisting>
                <para>It looks simple, easy to use, and everybody can get it. The problem is, well,
                    that it's not really asynchronous. True, our lambda will execute in another
                    thread. Actually, it's not even guaranteed either. But then, what do we do with
                    our future? Do we poll it? Or call get() as in the example? But then we will
                    block, right? And if we block, are we still asynchronous? If we block, we cannot
                    react to any event happening in our system any more, we are unresponsive for a
                    while (are we back to the old times of freezing programs, the old time before
                    threads?). We also probably miss some opportunities to fully use our hardware as
                    we could be doing something more useful at the same time, as in our fast-food
                    example. And diagnostics are looking bad too as we are blocked and cannot
                    deliver any. What is left to us is polling. And if we get more and more futures,
                    do we carry a bag of them with us at any time and check them from time to time?
                    Do we need some functions to, at a given point, wait for all futures or any of
                    them to be ready? </para>
                <para>Wait, yes they exist, <code>wait_for_all</code> and
                    <code>wait_for_any</code>... </para>
                <para>And what about this example from an online documentation?</para>
                <para>
                    <programlisting>{ 
   std::async(std::launch::async, []{ f(); }); 
   std::async(std::launch::async, []{ g(); });
}</programlisting>
                </para>
                <para>Every std::async returns you a future, a particularly mean one which blocks
                    upon destruction. This means that the second line will not execute until f()
                    completes. Now this is not only not asynchronous, it's also much slower than
                    calling sequentially f and g while doing the same.</para>
                <para>No, really, this does not look good. Do we have alternatives?</para>
            </sect1>
            <sect1>
                <title>N3558 / N3650</title>
                <para>Of course it did not go unnoticed that std::async has some limitations. And so
                    do we see some tries to save it instead of giving it up. Usually, it goes around
                    the lines of blocking, but later.</para>
                <para>
                    <programlisting>future&lt;int> f1 = async([]() { return 123; }); 
future&lt;string> f2 = f1.then([](future&lt;int> f) 
{ 
  return f.get().to_string(); // here .get() won’t block 
});
// and here?
string s= f2.get();</programlisting>
                </para>
                <para>The idea is to make std::async more asynchronous (this already just sounds
                    bad) by adding something (.then) to be called when the asynchronous action
                    finishes. It still does not fly:<itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>at some point, we will have to block, thus ending our asynchronous
                                behavior</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>This works only for very small programs. Do we imagine a 500k
                                lines program built that way?</para>
                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist></para>
                <para>And what about the suggestion of adding new keywords, async and await, as in
                    N3650? Nope. First because, as await suggests, someone will need, at some point,
                    to block waiting. Second because as we have no future, we also lose our polling
                    option.</para>

                <para>A thread-unsafe Servant is hidden behind a Proxy, which offers the same
                    members as the Servant itself. This Proxy is called by clients and delivers a
                    future object, which will, at some later point, contain the result of the
                    corresponding member called on the servant. The Proxy packs a MethodRequest
                    corresponding to a Servant call into the ActivationQueue. The Scheduler waits
                    permanently for MethodRequests in the queue, dequeues them, and executes them.
                    As only one scheduler waits for requests, it serializes access to the Servant,
                    thus providing thread-safety.</para>

                        >Boost.Asio documentation</link> for a full explanation. Boost Asynchronous
                    is very similar. It supports enqueueing asynchronous operations and waiting for
                    callbacks, offering extensions: safe callbacks, threadpools, proxies,
                    etc.</para>

                <title>Active Component</title>
                <subtitle>Extending Active Objects with more servants within a thread
                    context</subtitle>
                <para>A commonly cited drawback of Active Objects is that they are awfully
                    expensive. A thread per object is really a waste of ressources.
                    Boost.Asynchronous extends this concept by allowing an unlimited number of
                    objects to live within a single thread context, thus amortizing the costs. It
                    even provides a way for n Active Objects to share m threads while still being
                    called single thread. This allows tuning thread usage.</para>
                <para>As many objects are potentially living in a thread context, none should be
                    allowed to process long-lasting tasks as it would reduce reactivity of the whole
                    component. In this aspect, Asynchronous' philosophy is closer to a
                    Proactor.</para>
                <para>As long-lasting tasks do happen, Boost.Asynchronous provides several
                    implementations of threadpools and the needed infrastructure to make it safe to
                    post work to threadpools and get aynchronously a safe callback. It also provides
                    safe mechanisms to shutdown Active Components and threadpools.</para>

            <sect1>
                <title>Better Architecture</title>
                <para>We all learned in our design books that a software should be organized into
                    layers. This is, however, easier said than done, single-threaded, but much worse
                    when layers are having their own threads. Let's say, layer A is on top and
                    basing itself on layer B. A creates B and keeps it alive as long as it lives
                    itself. A and B are each composed of hundreds of classes / objects. Our standard
                    communication is A => B, meaning A gives orders to B, which executes them. This
                    is the theory. Unfortunately, B needs to give answers, usually delayed, to A.
                    Unfortunately, A and B live in different threads. This means mutexes. Ouch. Now
                    we are forced to check every class of A and protect it. Worse, the object of A
                    getting an answer might have long been destroyed. Ouch again. What to do? We
                    could keep the object of A alive in the callback of B. But then we have a
                    dependency B -> A. Ouch again, bad design. We can also hide the dependency using
                    some type erasure mechanism. We still have a logical one as B keeps its owner,
                    A, alive. Then, we can use a weak_ptr so that B does not keep A alive. But when
                    we lock, we do keep A alive. It's for a short time, but what if A is shutting
                    down? It's lost, our layered design is broken.</para>
                <para>Asynchronous is more that a library providing a better std::async or some
                    parallel algorithms, it's first of all an architectural tool. In the above case,
                    we will decide that every layer will live in its own thread(s), called
                    schedulers in Asynchronous language. Deciding in which thread an object "lives"
                    is a key point of a good design. Then the top layer, A, will make a request to
                    B, aking a future as a result, or much better, providing a callback.
                    Asynchronous offers a callback safe in two ways: thread-safe and checking the
                    lifetime of the callback target. This callback is provided by
                        <code>make_safe_callback</code>. This simple tool is a major help in making
                    a safe and efficient design.</para>

                <title>Shutting down</title>
                <para>Shutting down a thread turns out to be harder in practice than expected, as
                    shown by several posts of surprise on the Boost mailing lists when Boost.Thread
                    tried to match the C++ Standard. Asynchronous hides all these ugly details. What
                    users see is a scheduler proxy object, which can be shared by any number of
                    objects, and running any number of threads, managed by a scheduler. The
                    scheduler proxy object manages the lifetime of the scheduler. </para>
                <para>When the last instance of the scheduler object is destroyed, the scheduler
                    thread is stopped. When the last instance of a scheduler proxy is destroyed, the
                    scheduler thread is joined. It's as simple as that. This makes threads shared
                    objects. </para>

            <sect1>
                <title>Object lifetime</title>
                <para>There are subtle bugs when living in a multithreaded world. Consider the
                    following class:</para>
                <para>
                    <programlisting>struct Unsafe
{
  void foo()
  {
    m_mutex.lock();
    // call private member
    m_mutex.unlock();
  }
private:
  void foobar()
  {
    //we are already locked when called, do something while locked
  }
  boost::mutex m_mutex;
};            </programlisting>
                </para>
                <para>This is called a thread-safe interface pattern. Public members lock, private
                    do not. Simple enough. Unfortunately, it doesn't fly.</para>
                <para>First one has the risk of deadlock if a private member calls a public one
                    while being called from another public member. If we forget to check one path of
                    execution within a class implementation, we get a deadlock. We'll have to test
                    every single path of execution to prove our code is correct. And this at every
                    commit.</para>
                <para>Usually, for any complex class, where there's a mutex, there is a race or a
                    deadlock...</para>
                <para>But even worse, the principle itself is not correct in C++. It supposes that a
                    class can protect itself. Well, no, it can't. Why? One cannot protect the
                    destructor. If the object (and the mutex) gets destroyed when a thread waits for
                    it in foo(), we get a crash or an exception. We can mitigate this with the use
                    of a shared_ptr, then we have no destructor call while someone waits for the
                    mutex. Unfortunately, we still have a risk of a signal, callback, etc. all those
                    things mixing badly with threads. And if we use too many shared_ptr's, we start
                    having lifetime issues or leaks. </para>
                <para>There are more lifetime issues, even without mutexes or threads. If you have
                    ever used Boost.Asio, a common mistake and an easy one is when a callback is
                    called in the proactor thread after an asynchronous operation, but the object
                    called is long gone and the callback invalid. Asynchronous provides <command
                        xlink:href="#trackable_servant">trackable_servant</command> which makes sure
                    that a callback is not called if the object which called the asynchronous
                    operation is gone. It also prevents a task posted in a threadpool to be called
                    if this condition occurs, which improves performance. Asynchronous also provides
                    a safe callback for use as Boost.Asio or similar asynchronous libraries.</para>

                <title>Servant Proxies</title>
                <para>Asynchronous offers <code>servant_proxy</code>, which makes the outside world
                    call members of a servant as if it was not living in an ActiveObject. It looks
                    like a thread-safe interface, but safe from deadlock and race conditions. </para>

                <para>Asynchronous can give us an interruptible cookie when we post a task to a
                    scheduler, and we can use it to <command xlink:href="#interrupting_tasks">stop a
                        posted task</command>. If not running yet, the task will not start, if
                    running, it will stop at the next interruption point, in the sense of the <link

                <para>Finding out how good your software is doing is not an easy task. Developers
                    are notoriously bad at it. You need to add lots of logging to find out which
                    function call takes too long and becomes a bottleneck. Finding out the minimum
                    required hardware to run your application is even harder.</para>
                <para>Asynchronous design helps here too. By logging the required time and the
                    frequency of tasks, it is easy to find out how many cores are needed.
                    Bottlenecks can be found by logging what the Active Component is doing and how
                    long. Finally, designing the asynchronous Active Component as state machines and
                    logging state changes will allow a better understanding of your system and make
                    visible potential for concurrency. Even for non-parallel algorithms, finding
                    out, using a state machine, the earliest point a task can be thrown to a
                    threadpool will give some low-hanging-fruit concurrency. Throw enough tasks to
                    the threadpool and manage this with a state machine and you might use your cores
                    with little effort. Parallelization can then be used later on by logging which
                    tasks are worth parallelized.</para>

                <title>Continuations</title>
                <para>Callbacks are great when you have a complex flow of operations which require a
                    state machine for management, however there are cases where callbacks are not an
                    ideal solution. Either because your application would require a constant
                    switching of context between single-threaded and parallel schedulers, or because
                    the single-threaded scheduler might be busy, which would delay completion of the
                    algorithm. A known example of this is a parallel fibonacci. In this case, one
                    can register a <command xlink:href="#continuations">continuation</command>,
                    which is to be executed upon completion of one or several tasks. </para>

                    dual 6-core Xeon, 24 threads with hyperthreading will cost much more than 2 x

                <para>Asynchronous offers this possibility for all schedulers at low performance

                <para>This is achieved by posting a task to the queue with the corresponding

                <para>This diagram shows an overview of the design behind Asynchronous. One or more
                    Servant objects live in a single-theaded world, communicating with the outside
                    world only through one or several queues, from which the single-threaded
                    scheduler pops tasks. Tasks are pushed by calling a member on a proxy
                    object.</para>
                <para>Like an Active Object, a client uses a proxy (a shared object type), which
                    offers the same members as the real servant, with the same parameters, the only
                    difference being the return type, a boost::future&lt;R>, with R being the return
                    type of the servant's member. All calls to a servant from the client side are
                    posted, which includes the servant constructor and destructor. When the last
                    instance of a servant is destroyed, be it used inside the Active Component or
                    outside, the servant destructor is posted.</para>
                <para>any_shared_scheduler is the part of the Active Object scheduler living inside
                    the Active Component. Servants do not hold it directly but hold an
                    any_weak_scheduler instead. The library will use it to create a posted callback
                    when a task executing in a worker threadpool is completed.</para>
                <para>Shutting down an Active Component is done automatically by not needing it. It
                    happens in the following order:<itemizedlist>

                    comes close to this: threads are not directly used, but instead owned by a
                    scheduler, in which one creates objects and tasks.</para>

                <para>We can call members on the proxy, almost as if they were called on Servant.
                    The library takes care of the posting and forwarding the arguments. When
                    required, a future is returned. Stack unwinding works, and when the servant
                    proxy goes out of scope, the servant destructor is posted. When the scheduler
                    goes out of scope, its thread is stopped and joined. The queue is processed
                    completely first. Of course, as many servants as desired can be created in this
                    scheduler context. Please have a look at <link

                <title>Using a threadpool from within a servant</title>
                <para>If you remember the principles of Asynchronous, blocking a single-thread
                    scheduler is taboo as it blocks the thread doing all the management of a system.
                    But what to do when one needs to execute long tasks? Asynchronous provides a
                    whole set of threadpools. A servant posts something to a threadpool, provides a
                    callback, then gets a result. Wait a minute. Callback? Is this not
                    thread-unsafe? Why not threadpools with futures, like usual? Because in a
                    perfectly asynchronous world, waiting for a future means blocking a servant
                    scheduler. One would argue that it is possible not to block on the future, and
                    instead ask if there is a result. But frankly, polling is not a nice solution
                    either.</para>
                <para>And what about thread-safety? Asynchronous takes care of this. A callback is
                    never called from a threadpool, but instead posted back to the queue of the
                    scheduler which posted the work. All the servant has to do, is to do nothing and
                    wait until the callback is executed. Note that this is not the same as a
                    blocking wait, the servant can still react to events.</para>
                <para>Clearly, this brings some new challenges as the flow of control gets harder to
                    follow. This is why a servant is often written using state machines. The
                    (biased) author suggests to have a look at the <link
                        xlink:href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/msm/doc/HTML/index.html"
                        > Meta State Machine library </link> , which plays nicely with
                    Asynchronous.</para>
                <para>But what about the usual proactor issues (crashes) when the servant has long
                    been destroyed when the callback is posted. Gone. Asynchronous <command
                        xml:id="trackable_servant"/><code>trackable_servant</code> post_callback
                    ensures that a callback is not called if the servant is gone. Better even, if
                    the servant has been destroyed, an unstarted posted task will not be
                    executed.</para>
                <para>What about another common issue? If one posts a task, say a lambda, which
                    captures a shared_ptr to an object per value, and this object is a
                    boost::signal? Then when the task object has been executed and is destroyed, one
                    could have a race on the signal deregistration. But again no. Asynchronous
                    ensures that a task created within a scheduler context gets destroyed in this
                    context.</para>
                <para>This is about the best protection one can get. What Asynchronous cannot
                    protect from are self-made races within a task (if you post a task with a
                    pointer to the servant, you're on your own and have to protect your servant). A
                    good rule of thumb is to consider data passed to a task as moved or passed by
                    value. To support this, Asynchronous does not copy tasks but moves them.</para>
                <para>Armed with these protections, let's give a try to a threadpool, starting with
                    the most basic one, <code>threadpool_scheduler</code> (more to come):</para>
                <programlisting>struct Servant : boost::asynchronous::trackable_servant&lt;>

    Servant(boost::asynchronous::any_weak_scheduler&lt;> scheduler)

                    Similarly, the long work will be executed by the threadpool only if Servant is
                    alive by the time it starts. Everything else stays the same, one creates a proxy

                    get a callback, not a future, because you absolutely refuse to block waiting for
                    a future (and you'll be very right of course!). Ideally, except for main(), you

                <para>Let's imagine that a manager object (a state machine for example) posted some
                    long-lasting work to a threadpool, but this long-lasting work really takes too
                    long. As we are in an asynchronous world and non-blocking, the manager object
                    realizes there is a problem and decides the task must be stopped otherwise the
                    whole application starts failing some real-time constraints (how would we do if
                    we were blocked, waiting for a future?). This is made possible by using another
                    form of posting, getting a handle, on which one can require interruption. As
                    Asynchronous does not kill threads, we'll use one of Boost.Thread predefined
                    interruption points. Supposing we have well-behaved tasks, they will be
                    interrupted at the next interruption point if they started, or if they did not
                    start yet because they are waiting in a queue, then they will never start. In
                    this <link xlink:href="examples/example_interrupt.cpp">example</link>, we have
                    very little to change but the post call. We use <code>interruptible_post_callback</code>
                    instead of <code>post_callback</code>. We get an <code>any_interruptible object</code>, which offers a

                <para>Developers are notoriously famous for being bad at guessing which part of
                    their code is inefficient. This is bad in itself, but even worse for a control
                    class like our post-callback servant as it reduces responsiveness. Knowing how
                    long a posted tasks or a callback lasts is therefore very useful. Knowing how
                    long take tasks executing in the threadpools is also essential to plan what
                    hardware one needs for an application(4 cores? Or 100?). We need to know what
                    our program is doing. Asynchronous provides logging per task to help there.
                    Let's have a look at some code. It's also time to start using our template

                <title>Generating HTML diagnostics</title>
                <para>We just saw how to programmatically get diagnostics from schedulers. This is
                    very useful, but nobody likes to do it manually, so the authors went the extra
                    mile and provide an HTML formatter for convenience. The <link
                        xlink:href="examples/example_html_diagnostics.cpp">included example</link>
                    shows how to use it. In this example, we have a Servant, living in its own
                    single-threaded scheduler called "Servant". It uses a threadpool call
                    "Threadpool". When the Servant's foo() method is called, it executes a
                    parallel_reduce(parallel_for(...)), or whatever you like. These operations are
                    named accordingly. We also create a third scheduler, called "Formatter
                    scheduler", which will be used by the formatter code. Yes, even this scheduler
                    will be logged too. The example creates a Servant, calls foo() on the proxy,
                    sleeps for a while (how long is passed to the example as argument), then
                    generates <link xlink:href="examples/in_progress.html">a first output
                        statistics</link>. Depending on the sleep time, the parallel work might or
                    might not be finished, so this is an intermediate result.</para>
                <para>We then wait for the tasks to finish, destroy the servant, so that its
                    destructor is logged too, and we generate a <link
                        xlink:href="examples/final.html">final diagnostics</link>.</para>
                <para>The HTML pages display the statistics for all schedulers, including the
                    formatter. It shows with different colors the waiting times of tasks (called
                    Scheduling time), the execution times, successful or failed separately, and the
                    added total time for each task, with max min, average duration. One can also
                    display the full list of tasks and even histograms. As this is a lot of
                    information, it is possible to hide part of it using checkboxes.</para>
                <para>One also gets the very useful information of how long are the different
                    scheduler queues, which gives a very good indication of how busy the system

                <para>The scheduler will handle these queues as having priorities: as long as there
                    are work items in the first queue, take them, if there are no, try in the
                    second, etc. If all queues are empty, the thread gives up his time slice and
                    sleeps until some work item arrives. If no priority is defined by posting, a
                    queue will be chosen (by default randomly, but this can be configured with a
                    policy). This has the advantage of reducing contention of the queue, even when
                    not using priorities. The servant defines the priority of the tasks it provides.
                    While this might seem surprising, it is a design choice to avoid that the coder
                    using a servant proxy interface would have to think about it, as you will see in
                    the second listing. To define a priority for a servant proxy, there is a second

                <para>We also have an extended version of <code>post_callback</code>, called by a

                <para>Note the two added priority values: the first one for the task posted to the
                    threadpool, the second for the priority of the callback posted back to the
                    servant scheduler. The string is the log name of the task, which we choose to
                    ignore here.</para>
                <para>The priority is in any case an indication, the scheduler is free to ignore it

                    the threadpool has a normal queue and cannot honor the request, but a threadpool
                    with an <code>any_queue_container</code> or a
                        <code>composite_threadpool_scheduler</code> can. The <link

                <para><code>any_queue_container</code> has two template arguments. The first, the
                    job type, is as always by default, a callable (<code>any_callable</code>) job.
                    The second is the policy which Asynchronous uses to find the desired queue for a
                    job. The default is <code>default_find_position</code>, which is as described
                    above, 0 means any position, all other values map to a queue, priorities >=
                    number of queues means last queue. Any position is by default random
                        (<code>default_random_push_policy</code>), but you might pick
                        <code>sequential_push_policy</code>, which keeps an atomic counter to post
                    jobs to queues in a sequential order.</para>

                <para>A multiqueue_... threadpool scheduler has a queue for each thread. This
                    reduces contention, making these faster than single queue schedulers, like
                    threadpool_scheduler. Furthermore, these schedulers support priority: the
                    priority given in post_future or post_callback is the (1-based) position of the
                    queue we want to post to. 0 means "any queue". A queue of priority 1 has a
                    higher priority than a queue with priority 2, etc. </para>

                <title>Threadpool Schedulers with several queues</title>
                <para>A queue container has advantages (different queue types, priority for single
                    threaded schedulers) but also disadvantages (takes jobs from one end of the
                    queue, which means potential cache misses, more typing work). If you don't need
                    different queue types for a threadpool but want to reduce contention, multiqueue
                    schedulers are for you. A normal <code>threadpool_scheduler</code> has x threads
                    and one queue, serving them. A <code>multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler</code> has
                    x threads and x queues, each serving a worker thread. Each thread looks for work
                    in its queue. If it doesn't find any, it looks for work in the previous one,
                    etc. until it finds one or inspected all the queues. As all threads steal from
                    the previous queue, there is little contention. The construction of this
                    threadpool is very similar to the simple
                    <code>threadpool_scheduler</code>:</para>

                <para>The first argument is the number of worker threads, which is at the same time
                    the number of queues. As for every scheduler, if the queue constructor takes

                    <title>Usage</title>
                
                <para>When a project becomes more complex, having a single threadpool for the whole
                    application does not offer enough flexibility in load planning. It is pretty
                    hard to avoid either oversubscription (more busy threads than available hardware
                    threads) or undersubscription. One would need one big threadpool with exactly
                    the number of threads available in the hardware. Unfortunately, if we have a
                    hardware with, say 12 hardware threads, parallelizing some work using all 12
                    might be slowlier than using only 8. One would need different threadpools of
                    different number of threads for the application. This, however, has the serious
                    drawback that there is a risk that some threadpools will be in overload, while
                    others are out of work unless we have work stealing between different
                    threadpools.</para>
                <para>The second issue is task priority. One can define priorities with several
                    queues or a queue container, but this ensures that only highest priority tasks
                    get executed if the system is coming close to overload. Ideally, it would be
                    great if we could decide how much compute power we give to each task
                    type.</para>
                <para>This is what <code>composite_threadpool_scheduler</code> solves. This pool
                        supports, like any other pool, the
                        <code>any_shared_scheduler_proxy</code>concept so you can use it in place of
                        the ones we used so far. The pool is composed of other pools
                            (<code>any_shared_scheduler_proxy</code> pools). It implements work
                        stealing between pools if a) the pools support it and b) the queue of a pool
                        also does. For example, we can create the following worker pool made of 3
                        sub-pools:</para>

// a multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler, 4 threads, each with a lockfree_spsc_queue of capacity 100

                <para>Another example of why to use this pool is reusing threads allocated to an

                <title>More flexibility in dividing servants among threads</title>
                <para>TODO example and code. We saw how to assign a servant or several servants to a
                    single thread scheduler. We can also create schedulers and divide servants among
                    them. This is very powerful but still has some constraints:<itemizedlist>

                            <para>We need to assign servants to schedulers while what we want is to
                                assign them to threads. We also have to consider how many schedulers
                                to create. This is not very flexible.</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>If a servant is taking too long, it blocks all other servants

                    </itemizedlist></para>
                <para>We can increase the flexibility and reduce latency by using a
                        <code>multiple_thread_scheduler</code>. This scheduler takes as first
                    argument a number of threads to use and a maximum number of client "worlds"
                    (clients living logically in the same thread context). What it does, is to
                    assign any of its threads to different client worlds, but only one thread can
                    service a world at a time. This means that the thread safety of servants is
                    preserved. At the same time, having any number of threads decreases latency
                    because if a servant keeps its thread busy, it does not block other servants
                    from being serviced. As we can choose the number of threads this scheduler will
                    use, we achieve very fine granularity in planing our thread resources.</para>
                <para>Another interesting characteristics of this scheduler is that its threads
                    service its servants in order. If a thread serviced servant x, it next tries to
                    service servant x+1. This makes for good pipelining capabilities as it increases
                    the odds that task is koved from a pipeline stage to the next one by the same
                    thread and will be hot in its cache.</para>

                <para>TODO example and code.On many systems, it can improve performance to bind
                    threads to a processor: better cache usage is likely as the OS does not move
                    threads from core to core. Mostly for threadpools this is an option you might
                    want to try.</para>
                <para>Usage is very simple. One needs to call
                        <code>processor_bind(core_index)</code> on a scheduler proxy. This function
                    takes a single argument, the core to which the first thread of the pool will be
                    bound. The second thread will be bound to core+1, etc.</para>

                <para>Let's create a simple but powerful example to illustrate its usage. We want to
                    create a TCP client, which connects several times to the same server, gets data
                    from it (in our case, the Boost license will do), then checks if the data is
                    coherent by comparing the results two-by-two. Of course, the client has to be
                    perfectly asynchronous and never block. We also want to guarantee some threads
                    for the communication and some for the calculation work. We also want to
                    communication threads to "help" by stealing some work if necessary.</para>
                <para>Let's start by creating a TCP client using Boost.Asio. A slightly modified
                    version of the async TCP client from the Asio documentation will do. All we
                    change is pass it a callback which it will call when the requested data is
                    ready. We now pack it into an Asynchronous trackable servant:</para>

                <para>The main noteworthy thing to notice is the call to <emphasis role="bold"

                    thread-local-storage, gives us the io_service associated with this thread (one
                    io_service per thread). This is needed by the Asio TCP client. Also noteworthy
                    is the argument to <code>test()</code>, a callback when the data is available. </para>
                <para>Wait a minute, is this not unsafe (called from an asio worker thread)? It is

                    returned strings 2 by 2 (cb1, cb2). Again, simple state machine, if the callback

                <title><command xml:id="callback_continuations"/>Continuation tasks</title>
                <para>A common limitation of threadpools is support for recursive tasks: tasks start
                    other tasks, which start other tasks and wait for them to complete to do a merge
                    of the part-results. Unfortunately, all threads in the threadpool will soon be
                    busy waiting and no task will ever complete. One can achieve this with a
                    controller object or state machine in a single-threaded scheduler waiting for
                    callbacks, but for very small tasks, using callbacks might just be too
                    expensive. In such cases, Asynchronous provides continuations: a task executes,
                    does something then creates a continuation which will be excuted as soon as all
                    child tasks complete.</para>

                    <title>General</title>
                    <para>The Hello World of recursive tasks is a parallel fibonacci. The naive
                        algorithm creates a task calculating fib(n). For this it will start a fib(n-1)
                        and fib(n-2) and block until both are done. These tasks will start more tasks,
                        etc. until a cutoff number, at which point recursion stops and fibonacci is
                        calculated serially. This approach has some problems: to avoid thread explosion,
                        we would need fibers, which are not available in Boost at the time of this
                        writing. Even with fibers, tasks would block, which means interrupting them is
                        not possible, and a stack will have to be paid for both. Performance will also
                        suffer. Furthermore, blocking simply isn't part of the asynchronous philosophy
                        of the library. Let's have a look how callback continuation tasks let us
                        implement a parallel fibonacci.</para>
                    <para>First of all, we need a serial fibonacci when n is less than the cutoff. This

                    Sometimes, however, we are forced to use libraries returning us only a future.
                    In this case, Asynchronous also offers "simple" continuations, which are
                    future-based. Consider the following trivial example. We consider we have a
                    task, called sub_task. We will simulate the future-returning library using
                        <code>post_future</code>. We want to divide our work between sub_task
                    instances, getting a callback when all complete. We can create a continuation
                    using these futures:</para>

                <para>At the time of this writing, a core i7-3930K with 6 cores and 3.2 GHz will
                    cost $560, so say $100 per core. Not a bad deal, so you buy it. Unfortunately,
                    some time later you realize you need more power. Ok, there is no i7 with more
                    cores and an Extreme Edition will be quite expensive for only a little more
                    power so you decide to go for a Xeon. A 12-core E5-2697v2 2.7GHz will go for
                    almost $3000 which means $250 per core, and for this you also have a lesser
                    frequency. And if you need later even more power, well, it will become really
                    expensive. Can Asynchronous help us use more power for cheap, and at best, with
                    little work? It does, as you guess ;-)</para>
                <para>Asynchronous provides a special pool, <code>tcp_server_scheduler</code>, which
                    will behave like any other scheduler but will not execute work itself, waiting
                    instead for clients to connect and steal some work. The client execute the work
                    on behalf of the <code>tcp_server_scheduler</code> and sends it back the
                    results. </para>
                <para>For this to work, there is however a condition: jobs must be (boost)

                        code, a complete framework for distributing tasks homogenously among
                        machines, by reusing standard component offered by the library: threadpools,
                        composite pools, clients, servers. If we really have client connecting or
                        not is secondary, all what can happen is that calculating our Fibonacci

                    <para>We also separate the task (Fibonacci) from the threadpool configuration,
                        from the network configuration, and from the control of the task (Servant),
                        leading us to highly reusable, extendable code.</para>
                    <para>In the next chapter, we will add a way to further distribute work among
                        not only machines, but whole networks. </para>

                    <para>We already distribute and parallelize work, so we can scale a great deal,
                        but our current model is one server, many clients, which means a potentially
                        high network load and a lesser scalability as more and more clients connect
                        to a server. What we want is a client/server combo application  where the
                        client steals and executes jobs and a server component of the same
                        application which steals jobs from the client on behalf of other clients.
                        What we want is to achieve something like this:</para>
                    <para><inlinemediaobject>

                            </imageobject>
                    </inlinemediaobject></para>
                 <para>We have our server application, as seen until now, called interestingly
                        ServerApplication on a machine called MainJobServer. This machine executes
                        work and offers at the same time a steal-from capability. We also have a
                        simple client called ClientApplication running on ClientMachine1, which
                        steals jobs and executes them itself without further delegating. We have
                        another client machine called ClientMachine2 on which
                        ClientServerApplication runs. This applications has two parts, a client
                        stealing jobs like ClientApplication and a server part stealing jobs from
                        the client part upon request. For example, another simple ClientApplication
                        running on ClientMachine2.1 connects to it and steals further jobs in case
                        ClientMachine2 is not executing them fast enough, or if ClientMachine2 is
                        only seen as a pass-through to move jobs execution to another network.
                        Sounds scalable. How hard is it to build? Not so hard, because in fact, we
                        already saw all we need to build this, so it's kind of a Lego game.</para>

                <title>Picking your archive</title>
                <para>By default, Asynchronous uses a Boost Text archive (text_oarchive,
                    text_iarchive), which is simple and efficient enough for our Fibonacci example,
                    but inefficient for tasks holding more data.</para>
                <para>Asynchronous supports any archive task, requires however a different job type
                    for this. At the moment, we can use a
                        <code>portable_binary_oarchive</code>/<code>portable_binary_iarchive</code>
                    by selecting <code>any_bin_serializable</code> as job. If Boost supports more
                    archive types, support is easy to add.</para>
                <para>The previous Fibonacci server example has been <link
                        xlink:href="examples/example_tcp_server_fib2_bin.cpp">rewritten</link> to use this
                    capability. The <link xlink:href="examples/simple_tcp_client_bin_archive.cpp">client</link> has also been rewritten using this new job type.</para>

                <title><command xml:id="parallel_algos"/>Parallel Algorithms (Christophe Henry / Tobias Holl)</title>
                <para>Asynchronous supports out of the box quite some asynchronous parallel
                    algorithms, as well as interesting combination usages. These algorithms are
                    callback-continuation-based. Some of these algorithms also support distributed
                    calculations as long as the user-provided functors are (meaning they must be
                    serializable).</para>
                <para>What is the point of adding yet another set of parallel algorithms which can
                    be found elsewhere? Because truly asynchronous algorithms are hard to find. By
                    this we mean non-blocking. If one needs parallel algorithms, it's because they
                    could need long to complete. And if they take long, we really do not want to
                    block until it happens.</para>
                <para>All of the algorithms are made for use in a worker threadpool. They represent
                    the work part of a <code>post_callback</code>;</para>
                <para>In the philosophy of Asynchronous, the programmer knows better the task size
                    where he wants to start parallelizing, so all these algorithms take a cutoff.
                    Work is cut into packets of this size.</para>
                <para>All range algorithms also have a version taking a continuation as range
                    argument. This allows to combine algorithms functional way, for example this
                    (more to come):</para>

                <para>Asynchronous implements the following algorithms. It is also indicated whether
                    the algorithm supports arguments passed as iterators, moved range, or
                    continuation. Indicated is also whether the algorithm is distributable.<table

                    <title>Finding the best cutoff</title>
                    <para>The algorithms described above all make use of a cutoff, which is the
                        number of elements where the algorithm should stop going parallel and
                        execute sequentially. It is sometimes also named grain size in the
                        literrature. Finding the best value can often make quite a big difference in
                        execution time. Unfortunately, the best cutoff differs greatly between
                        different processors or even machines. To make this task easier,
                        Asynchronous provides a helper function, <emphasis role="bold"
                            >find_best_cutoff</emphasis>, which helps finding the best cutoff. For
                        best results, it makes sense to use it at deployment time. <emphasis

                        parallel_spreadsort is a parallel version of Boost.Spreadsort if

                        mergesort. For the sequential part, parallel_sort uses std::sort,
                        parallel_stable_sort uses std::stable_sort, parallel_spreadsort uses
                        Boost.Spreadsort.</para>

                        of a performance penalty. For the sequential part, parallel_sort_inplace
                        uses std::sort, parallel_stable_sort_inplace uses std::stable_sort,

                <title>Parallel containers</title>
                <para>Any gain made by using a parallel algorithm can be reduced to nothing if the
                    calling codes spends most of its time creating a std::vector. Interestingly,
                    most parallel libraries provide parallel algorithms, but very few offer parallel
                    data structures. This is unfortunate because a container can be parallelized
                    with a great gain as long as the contained type either has a non-simple
                    constructor / destructor or simply is big enough, as our tests show (see
                    test/perf/perf_vector.cpp). Though memory allocating is not parallel,
                    constructors can be made so. Reallocating and resizing can also greatly
                    benefit.</para>
                <para>Asynchronous fills this gap by providing boost::asynchronous::vector. It can
                    be used as a parallel, synchronous type. Apart from the construction, it looks
                    and feels very much like a std::vector with an added threadpool. In this case,
                        <emphasis role="underline">it cannot be posted to its own threadpool without
                        releasing it</emphasis> (see release_scheduler / set_scheduler). It is

                <para>The vector supports the same constructors that std::vector, with as extra
                    parameters, the threadpool for parallel work, and a cutoff. Optionally, a name
                    used for logging and a threadpool priority can be given, for example:</para>

                <title>No cycle, ever</title>
                 <para>This is one of the first things one learns in a design class. Cycles are
                    evil. Everybody knows it. And yet, designs are often made without care in a too
                    agile process, dependency within an application is not thought out carefully
                    enough and cycles happen. What we do learn in these classes is that cycles make
                    our code monolithic and not reusable. What we however do not learn is how bad,
                    bad, bad this is in face of threads. It becomes impossible to follow the flow of
                    information, resource usage, degradation of performance. But the worst of all,
                    it becomes almost impossible to prevent deadlocks and resource leakage.</para>
                <para>Using Asynchronous will help write clean layered architectures. But it will
                    not replace carefully crafted designs, thinking before writing code and the
                    experience which make a good designer. Asynchronous will not be able to prevent
                    code having cycles in a design. </para>
                <para>Fortunately, there is an easy solution: back to the basics, well-thought
                    designs before coding, writing diagrams, using a real development process (hint:
                    an agile "process" is not all this in the author's mind).</para>

                <title>No "this" within a task.</title>
                <para>A very easy way to see if you are paving the way to a race even using
                    Asynchronous is to have a look at the captured variables of a lambda posted to a
                    threadpool. If you find "this", it's probably bad, unless you really know that
                    the single-thread code will do nothing. Apart from a simple application, this
                    will not be true. By extension, pointers, references, or even shared smart
                    pointers pointing to data living in a single-thread world is usually bad.</para>
                <para>Experience shows that there are only two safe way to pass data to a posted
                    task: copy for basic types or types having a trivial destructor and move for
                    everything else. Keep to this rule and you will be safe.</para>
                <para>On the other hand, "this" is okay in the capture list of a callback task as
                    Asynchronous will only call it if the servant is still alive.</para>

            <title>Queues</title>
            <para> Asynchronous provides a range of queues with different trade-offs. Use
                    <code>lockfree_queue</code> as default for a quickstart with
                Asynchronous.</para>
            <sect1>
                <title>threadsafe_list</title>
                <para>This queue is mostly the one presented in Anthony Williams' book, "C++
                    Concurrency In Action". It is made of a single linked list of nodes, with a
                    mutex at each end of the queue to minimize contention. It is reasonably fast and
                    of simple usage. It can be used in all configurations of pools.</para>
                <para>Its constructor does not require any parameter forwarded from the
                    scheduler.</para>
                <para>Stealing: from the same queue end as pop. Will be implemented better (from the
                    other end to reduce contention) in a future version.</para>
                <para><emphasis role="underline">Caution</emphasis>: crashes were noticed with gcc
                    4.8 while 4.7 and clang 3.3 seemed ok though the compiler might be the reason.
                    For this reason, lockfree_queue is now the default queue.</para>

                <para>This queue is a light wrapper around a <code>boost::lockfree::queue</code>,
                    which gives lockfree behavior at the cost of an extra dynamic memory allocation.
                    Please use this container as default when starting with Asynchronous.</para>
                <para>The container is faster than a <code>threadsafe_list</code>, provided one
                    manages to set the queue size to an optimum value. A too small size will cause
                    expensive memory allocations, a too big size will significantly degrade
                    performance.</para>

                    a <code>multiqueue_threadpool_scheduler</code> as consumer, with a

                <para>The scheduler is an extended version of single_thread_scheduler, where all
                    servants are operated by only one thread at a time, though not always the same
                    one. It creates a n (servants) to m (threads) dependency. The advantages of this
                    scheduler is that one long task will not block other servants, more flexibility
                    in distributing threads among servants, and better cache behaviour (a thread
                    tries to serve servants in order).</para>
                <para>This scheduler does not steal from other queues or pools, and does not get
                    stolen from to avoid races.</para>

                    behavior could be done using <code>any_queue_container</code>. The advantage is
                    that it allows the pool to be given 0 thread and only be stolen from. The cost
                    is a slight performance loss due to higher contention on the single

                <para>Asynchronous has been tested on Linux and Windows PCs, Intel and AMD, with the
                    above compilers, and with mingw.</para>
                <para>Asynchronous being based on Boost.Thread, can also work on Intel Xeon Phi with
                    a minor change: within Boost, all usage of boost::shared_ptr must be replaced by
                    std::shared_ptr. Strongly recommended is linking with tbbmalloc_proxy for better
                    performance.</para>

                <para>Asynchronous is header-only, but requires Boost libraries which are not. One
                    should link with: boost_system, boost_thread, boost_chrono and boost_date_time
